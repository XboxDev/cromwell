/**
 * usb_submit_urb - issue an asynchronous transfer request for an endpoint
 * @urb: pointer to the urb describing the request
 * @mem_flags: the type of memory to allocate, see kmalloc() for a list
 *	of valid options for this.
 *
 * This submits a transfer request, and transfers control of the URB
 * describing that request to the USB subsystem.  Request completion will
 * be indicated later, asynchronously, by calling the completion handler.
 * The three types of completion are success, error, and unlink
 * (also called "request cancellation").
 * URBs may be submitted in interrupt context.
 *
 * The caller must have correctly initialized the URB before submitting
 * it.  Functions such as usb_fill_bulk_urb() and usb_fill_control_urb() are
 * available to ensure that most fields are correctly initialized, for
 * the particular kind of transfer, although they will not initialize
 * any transfer flags.
 *
 * Successful submissions return 0; otherwise this routine returns a
 * negative error number.  If the submission is successful, the complete()
 * callback from the urb will be called exactly once, when the USB core and
 * host controller driver are finished with the urb.  When the completion
 * function is called, control of the URB is returned to the device
 * driver which issued the request.  The completion handler may then
 * immediately free or reuse that URB.
 *
 * For control endpoints, the synchronous usb_control_msg() call is
 * often used (in non-interrupt context) instead of this call.
 * That is often used through convenience wrappers, for the requests
 * that are standardized in the USB 2.0 specification.  For bulk
 * endpoints, a synchronous usb_bulk_msg() call is available.
 *
 * Request Queuing:
 *
 * URBs may be submitted to endpoints before previous ones complete, to
 * minimize the impact of interrupt latencies and system overhead on data
 * throughput.  This is required for continuous isochronous data streams,
 * and may also be required for some kinds of interrupt transfers. Such
 * queueing also maximizes bandwidth utilization by letting USB controllers
 * start work on later requests before driver software has finished the
 * completion processing for earlier requests.
 *
 * Bulk and Isochronous URBs may always be queued.  At this writing, all
 * mainstream host controller drivers support queueing for control and
 * interrupt transfer requests.
 *
 * Reserved Bandwidth Transfers:
 *
 * Periodic transfers (interrupt or isochronous) are performed repeatedly,
 * using the interval specified in the urb.  Submitting the first urb to
 * the endpoint reserves the bandwidth necessary to make those transfers.
 * If the USB subsystem can't allocate sufficient bandwidth to perform
 * the periodic request, submitting such a periodic request should fail.
 *
 * Device drivers must explicitly request that repetition, by ensuring that
 * some URB is always on the endpoint's queue (except possibly for short
 * periods during completion callacks).  When there is no longer an urb
 * queued, the endpoint's bandwidth reservation is canceled.  This means
 * drivers can use their completion handlers to ensure they keep bandwidth
 * they need, by reinitializing and resubmitting the just-completed urb
 * until the driver longer needs that periodic bandwidth.
 *
 * Memory Flags:
 *
 * The general rules for how to decide which mem_flags to use
 * are the same as for kmalloc.  There are four
 * different possible values; GFP_KERNEL, GFP_NOFS, GFP_NOIO and
 * GFP_ATOMIC.
 *
 * GFP_NOFS is not ever used, as it has not been implemented yet.
 *
 * GFP_ATOMIC is used when
 *   (a) you are inside a completion handler, an interrupt, bottom half,
 *       tasklet or timer, or
 *   (b) you are holding a spinlock or rwlock (does not apply to
 *       semaphores), or
 *   (c) current->state != TASK_RUNNING, this is the case only after
 *       you've changed it.
 *
 * GFP_NOIO is used in the block io path and error handling of storage
 * devices.
 *
 * All other situations use GFP_KERNEL.
 *
 * Some more specific rules for mem_flags can be inferred, such as
 *  (1) start_xmit, timeout, and receive methods of network drivers must
 *      use GFP_ATOMIC (they are called with a spinlock held);
 *  (2) queuecommand methods of scsi drivers must use GFP_ATOMIC (also
 *      called with a spinlock held);
 *  (3) If you use a kernel thread with a network driver you must use
 *      GFP_NOIO, unless (b) or (c) apply;
 *  (4) after you have done a down() you can use GFP_KERNEL, unless (b) or (c)
 *      apply or your are in a storage driver's block io path;
 *  (5) USB probe and disconnect can use GFP_KERNEL unless (b) or (c) apply; and
 *  (6) changing firmware on a running storage or net device uses
 *      GFP_NOIO, unless b) or c) apply
 *
