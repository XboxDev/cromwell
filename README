-----------
IMPORTANT... Don't run this code without backing up your EEPROM
contents somehow first.  Corruption has been observed during
development after crashes.  Don't ignore this warning!!!
-----------

This version is not yet usable by general users, it is the first
development version we are putting in CVS.  It has the filtror IO
enabled and so will not even do anything in a non-filtror
environment without the filtror stuff being disabled in boot.h.



This development release is based on crom 1.0 and has the following
additions:

 - interrupts, including the 18.2Hz coming to a C function, which
 increments a DWORD in the standard BIOS location

 - Master and Slave device detection and reporting

 - Automatic unlock is the drive reports security active, yet the
    code does not include the RC4 key from the original bootrom,
	  thanks to some cryptoanalysis by Franz (see BootHddKey.c)

 - ATA and ATAPI functionality for reading arbitrary sectors

 - ATAPI code to find out if there is a CD in the tray

 - El Torito Bootable CD functionality and MBR HDD booting ( <--
 only as far as reading the correct sector into a buffer)

 - Untested, but reasonably goodlooking code for displaying a
 proportional 4bpp antialised font (the font is also included
 as a 6K const struct), with colour and transparency support.
 Also code for 2D blitting.  All of this is compatible with
 offscreen compositing and is not hardcoded to any resolution
 (but assumes 32bpp).

 - The Linux boot stuff is removed in Cromwell

 In a later release, the size will be reduced to 256KBytes
 instead of 1MB; note that at this time the 256KBytes will
 have to be loaded at the start and end of any 1MByte
 flash or filtror.

 At the moment the code in BootResetAction.c initializes
 everything including the IDE, and then waits for a
 bootable CDROM to be loaded in the DVD drive.  When
 this happens, after a 5 - 10 seconds pause the
 contents of the executable boot sector for the CD will
 be dumped via filtror.
