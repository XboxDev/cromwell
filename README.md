========

**Cromwell** is a free, legal BIOS replacement for the original Xbox. It is
capable of loading Linux from the Xbox's Hard Disk, and CD-ROM. It is not able
to load original Xbox games, neither originals nor copies.

It can be installed and used in one of two ways:

* Flashed to a modchip: If selected, it will let you boot Linux. If not
  selected, it will load the original MS BIOS, so no functionality is lost.
* Flashed to the TSOP: this replaces the MS BIOS stored on the Xbox, and makes
  it impossible to play games (whether original or not).

The advantage of the second method is that it makes it possible to dedicate the
whole hard disk to Xbox-Linux.

**Xromwell** is a very similar program, built from the same source code.
However, instead of being a BIOS, it is an XBE (Xbox Executable), meaning that
it can be launched like other XBEs. It is not signed with the MS key, which
means you will need either a modchip with a BIOS that allows you to run unsigned
XBEs, or a softmod exploit, such as the UDE.

Cromwell/Xromwell also has a number of other functions, such as locking and
unlocking hard disks, and selecting video modes (PAL/NTSC switching).
